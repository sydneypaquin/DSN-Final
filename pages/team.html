                        The U12AA level is the highest level of competition for athletes in the U12 age group, designed for dedicated players looking to challenge themselves and compete at an advanced level. At this stage, athletes have already developed strong foundational skills in skating, passing, and game strategy, and are now focused on refining their abilities and mastering more complex aspects of the game. U12AA emphasizes advanced technical skills, quick decision-making, and teamwork, helping players grow both individually and as part of a cohesive unit.
                        Coaching at the U12AA level is geared toward pushing athletes to reach their full potential, with a focus on preparing them for the higher levels of ringette. Players will be introduced to more intense competition, including regional and potentially provincial tournaments, where they’ll face top teams from other associations.
                        The experience at U12AA goes beyond just improving athletic abilities—it also helps develop life skills like perseverance, discipline, and leadership. For young athletes passionate about ringette, U12AA offers an exciting opportunity to take their game to the next level, build strong bonds with teammates, and prepare for future success in the sport. This level is ideal for players who are committed to improving and excelling in a competitive environment.
